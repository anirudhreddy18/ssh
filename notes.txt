if a client computer wants to interact with a remote server, use secure shell(SSH)
and then you can install web servers or do anything with the server.
ssh is a communication protocol just like http, ftp etc
sshd is a deamon thread running on remote server(unix enabled by default).
2 ways:
  password
  public/private key

after connecting you can do anything, just like doing it on a local machine.
copies public key from local machine to remote server authorized keys file.if doing this first time, it asks for password.
scp protocol for transferring files from local to remote server.

setup multiple keys for multiple things, like for example different keys for a digital ocean server & github
ssh-keygen -t rsa and override the name of file, you now have multiple keys in .ssh directory.
if you have multiple keys then run, ssh-add file-name (not pub key)
after enabling ssh, set permit root login to no (disabled password based auth like root@ip)
hidden folders use ls -la

eval `ssh-agent -s` to allow ssh add just in case
